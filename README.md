# Boop Game

***

This game was created as a final project for my spring semester CS2401 class at Ohio University

You can find the rules for the game in the included PDF, called 'Boop_Rules.pdf', and you can compile using the typing 'make' into your terminal while in the game's directory

For this project, I was required to implement a child class of the Game class, called Boop, within that class I had to implement the game's logic and it's display. To do this, I was given the parent class, Game, and a basic main.cc file.
